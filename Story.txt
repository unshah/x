For Raja to capture a car, he needs to go on a drive in his current car and hit the car to swap it and bring it back to the garage by escaping the police for 1 day (1 mins in game).
Once he brings it to the garage the dealer pays him promised amount(10000, 15000, 25000, 40000).  But during the chase if Raja's car hits some other car there is damage and it is deducted
from the final amount or the car is lost if hits a police unless he pays some bribe.
